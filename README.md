# Teacher: Minetest Tutorial API and Interface

This mod provides an API and user interface for handling tutorials. This mod got inspiration from [GSI's tutorial system](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorial) and shared similar designs.

The API is documented as Lua Language Server annotations. An example of registering tutorials can be found in the shipped example mod, `teacher_tutorial_self`.
